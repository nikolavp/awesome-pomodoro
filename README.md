# Pomodoro Widget

## Usage

    cd ~/.config/awesome
    git clone git://github.com/nikolavp/awesome-pomodoro.git pomodoro

### In you rc.lua:

    // insert after beautiful.init("...")
    local pomodoro = require("pomodoro")

    // customizations to the showed text or the time a pomodoro should take
    // look in init.lua for more info
    (...)

    //init the pomodoro object with the current customizations
    pomodoro.init()

At this point there are two widget you will want to use in your wibox:

*    pomodoro.widget - the main widget that will display the time of the current pomodoro.

*    pomodoro.icon_widget - the icon that you can use to display close to the text.

### Add it to your wibox

You can use:

* only the text widget:

        mywibox[s].widgets = {
            pomodoro.widget,
            mytextclock,
        }

* only the icon widget:

        mywibox[s].widgets = {
            pomodoro.icon_widget,
            mytextclock,
        }

* or you can use them both:

        mywibox[s].widgets = {
            pomodoro,widget, pomodoro.icon_widget,
            mytextclock,
        }

## Customizations

customizations are done by setting variables under the pomodoro table. Note that those should be done before calling

    pomodoro.init()

### Change the default icon
For that you can use the following which requires beautiful:

    beautiful.pomodoro_icon = '/your/path/to/pomodoro/icon'

### Check out the init.lua too. For example if you don't want the text "Pomodoro:"

    pomodoro.pre_text = "" 

#### Execute a custom function on pomodoro finish

You can populate the tables:

*pomodoro.on_work_pomodoro_finish_callbacks* and *pomodoro.on_pause_pomodoro_finish_callbacks*

with functions to be called when the pomodoro finishes. on_pause_pomodoro_finish_callbacks functions will be called when a pause finishes and on_work_pomodoro_finish_callbacks functions are called when a pomodoro finishes.

Here is an example how I am using this to lock my screen on every pomodoro finish:

    pomodoro.on_work_pomodoro_finish_callbacks = {
        function()
            exec('slock')
        end
    }

#### Up/Down time with the mouse wheel

You can _up or down the time_ with the mouse wheel if you put your mouse on widget. By default, you
can up or down it minute by minute, but if you want you can change it. In init.lua, change the
variable _pomodoro.change_ to seconds that you want.

#### More customizations

Maybe there are more which are not documented here at the moment. Feel free to provide docs and send a pull request :)
